### Project: idENTify
Overview:
ENT doctors treat patients who often have chronic conditions and our product will make it easier 
for the staff to keep track of these patients, such as their appointment dates, the severity of their condition, 
their diagnosis, and allow admin staff to filter different types of patients.
