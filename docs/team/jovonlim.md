### Project: idENTify
Overview:
ENT doctors treat patients who often have chronic conditions and our product will make it easier
for the staff to keep track of these patients, such as their appointment dates, the severity of their condition,
their diagnosis, and allow admin staff to filter different types of patients.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

Code contributed: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=jovonlim&breakdown=true&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2022-09-16&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)

Enhancements implemented:
* `Appointment` Class with storage: To create different appointments for the patients and store those objects into JSON format.
* `Observer` pattern: Made use of observable and extractors to automatically update the listviews.
* `Book` Command: Allows users to book a new appointment for the specified patient.
* `Edit Appt` Command: Allows users to edit an existing appointment.
* `Mark` Command: Marking a recurring appointment will automatically book a new appointment for the patient.
* `History` feature with storage: Stores the most recent 10 commands and allows the user to cycle through them to reduce repetition of similar but long commands.

Contributions to the UG:

Updated `Intro`, `Quick Start` sections and added `Book` command, `Edit Appts` command and `History` feature.

Added UML diagrams and description for `book` command.
