NUScheduler is a desktop app for **NUS students who have a large network of contacts to manage, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, NUScheduler can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

With NUScheduler, you can store the contact details of the NUS community around you and manage your classes and events effectively.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Command format

All commands used in NUScheduler follow this command format:
```
<command word> <option flag> <parameters>
```

### Command Word

Command words are used to specify what to perform the operation on.

* Command words are case-sensitive, e.g. `exit` will work, but not `EXIT`.

### Option Flag

Option flags are used to specify the operation to perform.

* Option flags are prefixed by `-`, and are case-sensitive, e.g. `-v` will work, but not `-V`.
* Option flags must be specified right after the command word.
* Optional flags are only applicable for the profile and event command words.

### Parameters

Parameters are extra inputs the command may require.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters you will specify.<br>
  e.g. in `profile -a n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `profile -a n/John Doe`.
* Parameters in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Parameters with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times, including zero times for optional items.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
  e.g. `pr/PROFILE_INDEX…​` must be used at least once, such as `pr/1`, `pr/3 pr/5` etc.
* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.
* Parameters may be prefixed, and the prefix is case-sensitive.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
Parameters can be in any order. e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
</div>

| Prefix | Parameter |
|:------:|:---------:|
| hello  |   world   |

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
