* **idENTify** is a desktop application targeted at admin staff working at an ENT department. 
Patients often have chronic conditions and our product will make it easier for the staff to keep track of these patients,
such as their appointment dates, the severity of their condition, their diagnosis, and allow admin staff to filter different types of patients. <br>
  Example usages:
  * allows staff to check for upcoming appointments easily.
  * as a tracking tool for staff to easily find information and identify a patient.
